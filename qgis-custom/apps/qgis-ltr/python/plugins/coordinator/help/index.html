<p>Coordinators basic function is to just transform input coordinates into output
coordinates through a &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; coordinate transformation. The coordinator panel is structured
in two sections: The upper section represents the input, the lower the output of the
current coordinate transformation.</p>

<h4 id="transformation">Transformation</h4>

<p>The Input Coordinate Reference System (CRS) can be selected arbitrarily while
the Output CRS is connected with the currently active layer by default. If the user
selects another layer, the Output CRS changes accordingly. This behavior can be changed by toggling
the lock button in the lower section &mdash; if unlocked the output CRS can also be selected
independently from the active layer.</p>

<h4 id="input">Input</h4>

<p>There are two ways to enter new coordinates into the transformation:
1. by entering manually into the panel or
2. by capturing the coordinates with the picker from the map</p>

<p>Any input is transformed instantly.</p>

<p>Besides decimal coordinates both the input and the output support geographic coordinates
also in Degree/Minute/Seconds units (DMS) by selecting the appropriate option for the corresponding
section. If in DMS mode, buttons to switch the coordinate&#8217;s hemisphere (North/South or East/West) become
active.</p>

<p>All the input can be cleared by pressing the corresponding button.</p>

<h4 id="map-visualization">Map Visualization</h4>

<p><img src="images/screen_maptools.png" alt="Maptools" /></p>

<p>The currently entered coordinate is marked on the main canvas with a circle. The marker can
be hidden by toggling the corresponding button. If the coordinate is currently not within
the current main canvas extent, a warning is shown.</p>

<p>By clicking the &#8220;Pan Map&#8221; button, the map is centered on the current coordinate. The
map&#8217;s scale is not changed.</p>

<h4 id="coordinate-capture">Coordinate Capture</h4>

<p><img src="images/screen_capture.png" alt="Maptools" /></p>

<p>The input coordinate can be captured from the map canvas with the picker tool activated with the corresponding
button. The input CRS does <em>not</em> have to be in the CRS of the map or currently active
layer.</p>

<h4 id="copy-result-to-clipboard">Copy Result to Clipboard</h4>

<p><img src="images/screen_copy.png" alt="Copy Tools" /></p>

<p>The output of the transformation displayed in the lower section can be copied to the
clipboard as a whole with the button to the right. In this case both coordinate components
are separated by a tab for easy pasting into spreadsheet applications.</p>

<p>With the smaller copy buttons above the output coordinates components, only the respective
value is copied to clipboard.</p>

<h4 id="digitizing">Digitizing</h4>

<p><img src="images/screen_digitize.png" alt="Digitizing" /></p>

<p>Coordinator provides ways to create features based on the currently entered coordinates. The
corresponding button in the lower section is enabled when the user has a vector opened
for editing <strong>and</strong> is currently adding a feature <strong>and</strong> valid coordinates are entered
as input.</p>

<ul>
<li>For a layer with <strong>Point Geometry</strong> this means the &#8220;Add Point Feature"-Tool is enabled.
Now, if the user clicks the &#8220;Add Coordinates"-Button, a new point feature is added
to the layer. If attributes are to be entered for this new feature, the corresponding
dialog is opened.</li>
<li>For layers with <strong>Line or Polygon Geometry</strong>, the &#8220;Add Line/Polygon Feature&#8221;
needs to be enabled. &#8220;Add Coordinates&#8221; adds the current coordinates to the
current line or polygon rubberband or starts a new feature with the current coordinates
as starting point. To actually create the new feature the user still has to finalize
it &mdash; for example by right-clicking into the map.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that neither CRS of the transformation needs to be in the layer&#8217;s CRS.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</h2>

<h3 id="stepwise-input-change">Stepwise Input change</h3>

<p>All input fields support stepwise change by using the directional keys on the keyboard
or the mouse wheel. For example you can increment an input field by one by pressing
the &#8220;up"-arrow or by scrolling up while that field is active.</p>

<h3 id="hemisphere-switching">Hemisphere switching</h3>

<p>Pressing &#8216;-&#8217; (minus-key) in an input field switches the hemisphere of the coordinate
if the current input CRS is a geographic one.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-digitize">Keyboard Digitize</h3>

<p>Pressing Enter/Return in any input field performs a coordinate digitization if currently
possible. It&#8217;s therefore possible to digitize a bunch of coordinates manually, for example
when reading from unstructured coordinate lists.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>Tests can be run with the QGIS python console or in a terminal with the appropriate environment ( e.g. PYTHONPATH, QT plugin path, 
QGIS<em>PREFIX</em>PATH &#8230;).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to execute <strong>inside QGIS</strong>, open Plugins -> Python console&#8230; and enter
~~~ 
import coordinator.test
coordinator.test.run_all()
~~~</p></li>
<li><p>to execute <strong>in a terminal</strong> make sure the  environment variables are set correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PATH</code> (should prefer the QGIS installation binaries, especially python)</li>
<li><code>QGIS_PREFIX_PATH</code> (usually <code>&lt;QGIS installation path&gt;/apps/qgis</code>)</li>
<li><code>QT_PLUGIN_PATH</code>: <code>QGIS_PREFIX_PATH</code> + <code>/../Qt5/plugins</code></li>
<li><code>PYTHONPATH</code> (usually <code>QGIS_PREFIX_PATH</code> + <code>/python</code> and + <code>/../Qt5/python</code> and the 
QGIS profile plugin folder )</li>
</ul>

<p><p>then execute
~~~
python -m coordinator.test
~~~</p></li>
</ul></p>
