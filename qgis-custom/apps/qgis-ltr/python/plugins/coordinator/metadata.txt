about=The purpose of this plugin is to make handling of coordinate IO easier and includes a transformation tool and supports creation of simple features.
 This plugin overlaps in different ways with the purpose of the plugins Coordinate Capture, Lat Lon Tools and the Advanced Digitize Panel. It however aims to integrate in a clean and simple interface multiple tasks these tools are sometimes used together. And yes...: Its almost as it's just another coordinate tool. :)
 The two main functions of this plugin are: 
 (A) a simple and easy to use coordinate transformation tool with an integrated picker and 
 (B) a quick to use coordinate digitizer with support for coordinates in an arbitrary CRS independent of project or layer CRS. 
 Both of these functions are seamlessly integrated and are implemented as a single, unique operation.
