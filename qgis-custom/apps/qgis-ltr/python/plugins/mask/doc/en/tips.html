<h2>How to filter out legend elements based on the mask ?</h2>
<p>One may want to use the mask to highlight some part of a map. In which case, one may want to hide
  elements of the legend (in a composition) that are not displayed inside the polygon of the mask.</p>
<p>The <tt>in_mask</tt> function can be used for that purpose. Starting with QGIS 2.14, a new option
  has been added to the legend filter tool, allowing to specify an expression. A symbol will be part of
  the legend only if at least one of its features make the boolean expression evaluated to true.</p>
<p>That can especially be used to filter out features that are not visible inside the mask by using
  the function <tt>in_mask(SRID)</tt>. The first argument must be the EPSG code of the target CRS of the evaluated features.
  For example <tt>in_mask(2154)</tt> for a French Lambert 93.</p>
  <p>Use in_mask(0) if all layers (mask and labels) are in the same projection.</p>
